# Native App Studio: Buurst Stats
By Matthew van Rijn (10779353)

This app shows statistics about the neighbourhood in which the user is situated.

### Activities
There are two activities, one for showing stats and one for changing settings. The stats activity implements a drawer which allows the user to switch between fragments showing different kinds of statistics. The settings activity allows the user to change the app settings, which are saved on firebase.
